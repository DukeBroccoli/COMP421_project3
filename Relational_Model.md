* A health institute can only be either a community clinic or a birth center.
* Only the coupleâ€™s designated primary/backup midwife can have an appointment with the midwife.
* Primary and backup midwives cannot be the same person.
* Only couples who registered for a session are allowed to attend the session.
* Register date of an info session should be before the date that the session is held.
* Sample time of time should be after start time of an appointment.
